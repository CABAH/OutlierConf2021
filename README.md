# OutlierConf2021

Slides and hands-on codes for my talk "ggplot WIzardry: My Favorite Tricks and Secrets for Beautiful Plots in R" at the [1st OutlierConf](https://www.outlierconf.com/), February 4–7 2021.

### About the talk:

> In this talk, I present my favorite tips and tricks with regard to the ggplot2 package, a library for plotting in the programming language R. I will cover functions that are helpful but many may not be aware of as well as a collection of interesting functions from a large range of extension packages.  
The talk is intended for people who already know how to code in R and ggplot2. However, I am going to cover a diverse collection of tips so I hope everyone can pick something helpful independent from their level of expertise.
