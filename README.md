### About the talk:

> In this talk, I present my favorite tips and tricks with regard to the ggplot2 package, a library for plotting in the programming language R. I will cover functions that are helpful but many may not be aware of as well as a collection of interesting functions from a large range of extension packages.  
The talk is intended for people who already know how to code in R and ggplot2. However, I am going to cover a diverse collection of tips so I hope everyone can pick something helpful independent from their level of expertise.
